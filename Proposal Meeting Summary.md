#EENG/515 
- Broadly speaking our project is on-topic and in-scope, although it is much more exploratory and nebulous than is common for this class 
	- As a result there is a greater risk of hitting a dead end or other issues 
- We should consider both analysis (decomposition of signal) and synthesis (reconstruction of signal) with respect to these alternative sin and cos functions 
	- Note that is is very possible that these alternative versions may not be orthogonal like the original sin and cos, and thus we may have to bring the full normal equations into play to do this analysis/synthesis 
		- If this is the case, things will get harder
	- They may also wind up not being linearly independent, in which case we may have connections to the matrix condition number to quantify their degree of linear independence (or lack thereof)
- It would be interesting (and convenient if true) to see if the FFT can be extended to work with these alternative sin and cos 
- We will need to obtain better references to better contextualize this with other work 
- Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions (functions for which a given operator does not change, except perhaps by a scaling factor) appear to be a related concept we might want to look into as an alternative if the original idea falls apart, or if we see a connection/something interesting we want to investigate 
- Of note is that shortly after our meeting, we realized that if it is the case that different sin functions take different numbers of Fourier terms to represent a signal with the same accuracy (which is highly likely based on our initial investigations), then we may be able to create a signal compression algorithm by varying which sin function is used.
